# Technical Requirements Document (TRD): Canvas Copycat LMS

## 1. Overview
The project aims to develop a Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by Canvas, with a strong focus on video-based learning similar to YouTube. The platform will support two user roles: Administrators (instructors) and Students. Administrators can upload and manage video content, while students can only access and view content. The system will categorize content by subject and grade level, providing a structured and user-friendly educational experience.

## 2. Technology Stack
The backend will be built using Django, leveraging its robust authentication, ORM, and admin capabilities. The frontend will use Django templates for rapid prototyping, with the option to integrate React or Vue.js for a more dynamic user experience in the future. Video playback will utilize HTML5 video elements, with support for streaming and adaptive quality. The database will be PostgreSQL for production, with SQLite for development.

## 3. User Authentication and Roles
User authentication will be handled by Django’s built-in authentication system. There will be two primary user roles:
- **Administrator**: Can upload, edit, and delete video content; manage categories, subjects, and grade levels; and view analytics.
- **Student**: Can register, log in, browse, and view video content, but cannot upload or modify content.
Role-based access control will be enforced throughout the application to ensure proper permissions.

## 4. Video Content Management
Administrators will have access to a dashboard for uploading video content. Each video will have metadata including title, description, subject, grade level, and tags. Videos will be stored securely on the server or integrated with a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3) for scalability. The system will generate video thumbnails and support multiple video formats for compatibility.

## 5. Video Playback Features
The video player will offer features similar to YouTube, including play/pause, seek, volume control, fullscreen mode, and playback speed adjustment. The player will display video metadata and allow students to view related videos based on subject or grade level. Future enhancements may include captions, video quality selection, and analytics on viewing behavior.

## 6. Content Organization: Categories, Subjects, and Grade Levels
Content will be organized into a hierarchy: Categories (e.g., STEM, Humanities), Subjects (e.g., Math, History), and Grade Levels (e.g., Grade 6, Grade 12). Administrators can create and manage these organizational units. Students can filter and browse content by category, subject, and grade level, making it easy to find relevant materials.

## 7. User Interface and Experience
The UI will be clean and intuitive, with a dashboard for administrators and a content library for students. Navigation will include search, filtering, and sorting options. Responsive design will ensure usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Accessibility standards (WCAG) will be followed to accommodate all users.

## 8. Security and Privacy
All user data and video content will be protected using Django’s security best practices. User passwords will be hashed, and sensitive operations will require authentication. Video URLs will be protected to prevent unauthorized access. The system will comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., FERPA, GDPR) as applicable.

## 9. Extensibility and Future Features
The system will be designed with extensibility in mind. Future features may include quizzes, assignments, discussion forums, progress tracking, and integration with third-party tools (e.g., Zoom, Google Classroom). The codebase will follow Django best practices to facilitate maintenance and expansion.

## 10. Deployment and Maintenance
The application will be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will automate testing and deployment. Documentation will be provided for setup, usage, and contribution guidelines. Regular maintenance and updates will ensure the platform remains secure and functional.
